## Example problem: IDOR on asciinema

#### Answers First
If I get absolutely stuck, I come here

#### Basics

Learning the HTTP Spec

There's always time to come back and learn this.
In fact, you'll need to if you want to 'LEVEL'

#### Practical Application First
This one is me. I want to learn things that help
me solve problems directly in front of me.

## Regardless of Style, Understand your Tools

???
- Make it easy for yourself to learn
- Don't fight with your tools while learning
- Read man Pages
- Learn your shell
- Bootcamps and Ruby

--
a.k.a `man $tool` and `--help` all the things!

# Deliberate Practice

---

# Vulnhub.com

--

- Use the Walkthroughs
- Resist the feeling that it's 'cheating'

--

# Find Ongoing CTFs

--

- HackTheBox.eu
- CTF Archives

--

# Social Learning

--
* Live Events

--
* Communities
  - Meetup.com
  - NetSecFocus Mattermost - chat.netsecfocus.com
  - DC201 or other local DefCon groups

???
- Start with walkthroughs as intruction manuals
- After 2-4, try alone
- Creep scroll just enough to get unstuck

### How would I automate this?

???
This one is my favorite. It's essentially a different version of 'How do you explain it?'

By automating the solution, you're forced to think about the problem in a deterministic way.

You encounter edge cases that could introduce more learning opportuinities along the way.

EX: Draw an Owl vs. Tell me what an Owl is

---
# Explain it
After inspecting the network traffic, some obfuscated code was found.

The code brought our attention to a function in the global scope, `makeInviteCode()`

This function POSTs to endpoint `/how/to/generate/invite` which return some encoded JSON.

Upon decoding, we're instructed to POST to another endpoint. The response data is the encoded
invite code.

---

# How Else Can We Solve it?

--

* Manually inspect all non-standard globally define functions
* Use BURPSuite to see calls that are made
* Bruteforce the api endpoints

--

# What If We Can't Use Postman?

--

* Use jQuery to make the required calls
* BURPsuite
* curl
* Python Requests
* Ruby Net::HTTP

# AUTOMATE IT!!

```bash
# API Endpoint Information Disclosure
1  curl -sL -X POST \
2    'https://www.hackthebox.eu/api/invite/how/to/generate' \
3    | jq '.data.data' \ # pull data.data property from resulting json
4    | tr -d '"' \       # delete all instances of the "
5    | base64 -d         # decode base64


#> In order to generate the invite code,
#> make a POST request to /api/invite/generate%


# Call 'hidden' endpoint
6  curl -sL -X POST \
7    'https://www.hackthebox.eu/api/invite/generate' \
8    | jq -r '.data.code' \ # I learned about -r making this slide!
9    | base64 -d
